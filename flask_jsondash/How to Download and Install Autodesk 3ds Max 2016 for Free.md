Now that you have installed Autodesk 3ds Max 2016, you might be wondering how to use it. In this section, we will give you a brief overview of the main features and tools of this software.
 
### The User Interface
 
The user interface of 3ds Max 2016 consists of several elements, such as the menu bar, the ribbon, the command panel, the viewport, the scene explorer, the status bar and the quick access toolbar. You can customize the layout and appearance of these elements according to your preferences and workflow.
 
The menu bar contains various menus that provide access to different commands and options. The ribbon is a tabbed toolbar that contains buttons and controls for common tasks and tools. The command panel is a dockable panel that contains tabs for creating and modifying objects, shapes, modifiers, materials and animation. The viewport is the main window where you can view and interact with your scene. You can have up to four viewports with different views and settings. The scene explorer is a panel that displays a hierarchical list of all the objects in your scene. You can use it to select, rename, hide, freeze and organize your objects. The status bar is located at the bottom of the interface and shows information about your scene, such as the coordinates, the frame rate and the selection. The quick access toolbar is located at the top left corner of the interface and contains buttons for frequently used commands, such as save, undo and redo.
 
### The Basic Workflow
 
The basic workflow of 3ds Max 2016 involves creating and importing objects, applying modifiers and materials, setting up lights and cameras, animating and rendering your scene. You can use the command panel to create or import various types of objects, such as primitives, splines, meshes, NURBS, particles and bones. You can also use the ribbon to access some of the creation tools.
 
Once you have created or imported your objects, you can use modifiers to change their shape and appearance. Modifiers are non-destructive operations that can be applied to any object in a stack. You can add, remove or reorder modifiers in the command panel or in the modifier list. Some of the common modifiers are bend, twist, taper, noise, shell and UVW map.
 
To apply materials to your objects, you can use the material editor. The material editor is a dialog box that allows you to create and edit materials using nodes and parameters. You can access it by pressing M on your keyboard or by clicking on the material editor button on the main toolbar. You can use different types of materials, such as standard, physical or mental ray materials. You can also apply textures, maps and shaders to your materials to enhance their realism.
 
To set up lights and cameras in your scene, you can use the create panel or the ribbon. You can create different types of lights, such as omni, spot, directional or area lights. You can also create different types of cameras, such as free, target or physical cameras. You can adjust their properties and settings in the modify panel or in the viewport.
 
To animate your scene, you can use various tools and methods, such as keyframes, curves, constraints or controllers. You can use the animation panel or the timeline to set keyframes for your objects' position, rotation or scale. You can also use the curve editor or the dope sheet to edit your animation curves or keys. You can use constraints to link objects together or to make them follow a path or a surface. You can use controllers to control how objects move or react to other objects or events.
 
To render your scene, you can use the render setup dialog box or the render menu. You can choose different renderers, such as scanline, mental ray or iray. You can also adjust various render settings, such as output size, quality, anti-aliasing or global illumination. You can preview your render in the active viewport or in a separate window.
